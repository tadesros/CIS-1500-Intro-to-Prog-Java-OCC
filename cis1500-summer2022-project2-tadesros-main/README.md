Create a 'text based adventure game' styled after the famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork

Create several action and navigation options for a player to choose from, and a 'help' option that displays all the available choices ( except the secret escape word ).

One of the actions should 'wound' the player and if a player is too wounded, they are required to sleep before they can continue.  The only acceptable option for a 'wounded' player is to sleep.  After they sleep, they are no longer wounded.

Each command will always give the same response to the player regardless of where they are.

Add at least 4 'action' commands, at least 4 'navigation' commands like Go North, an option to sleep, an option for help, and a secret escape word that ends the game.

If the command isn't recognized, display the help text

Count the number of 'turns' the player is in the game for, don't count the help command as a turn and display the # when the game ends
