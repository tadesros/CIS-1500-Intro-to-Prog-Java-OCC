Please submit the URL to your repository AND a self assessment using the rubric.

Please write a Java class for a Geocache, include private attributes for latitude,
longitude, hint, item, and likeCount

Include a constructor that accepts values for latitude, longitude, hint, 
and item. 

Default likeCount to 0.

latitude, longitude and hint should not be changed once they are set, but should have 
get methods for accessing their values

item should be able to be changed if someone finds the geocache and wants to exchange 
items ( using get and set methods )

likeCount should have a get method, and a method like() which increases the like count by 1.

Include unit tests for the constructor/get methods, and tests for setting the item and liking 
the geocache
